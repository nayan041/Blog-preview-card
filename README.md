## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Media Query

### What I learned
Spacing is very much complicated to me. It is important to maintain proper spacing using CSS. Media Query, `box-shadow`, `.root` pseudo class, `var()` method and variable `@font-face` using methods.

Figma design related guide and Git related learning is very much helpful. Thanks to **Frontend Mentor** for written guidance.


### Continued development
CSS proper spacing and HTML nested structure limiting techniques.

### Useful resources
